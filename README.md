# Java-training ðŸ’ª
<h3>Directory where I will store exercises to train myself to master Java.</h3>

<strong>For the moment, two directories are present:</strong>

- [exercism](src/main/java/com/hatcattt/exercism) : from the website https://exercism.org
- [stream](src/main/java/com/hatcattt/streams) : for the Stream API, from various websites

There is always a text file (things to do) for each exercise in the folder :
- [ressources](src/main/resources/enonces)<br>

n.b: *Some exercises will be in French, others in English.*
